\usage{
AverageJ(CleanedData, spatialPoints, timePoints)
}
\arguments{
\item{CleanedData}{A matrix of containing 1 column of distance markers (column 1, "Distance") and multiple columns of fluorescence readings at various timepoints. Output from the taRdis function backtract is appropriate input for the function AverageJ.}

\item{spatialPoints}{the number of distance markers included in CleanedData (i.e. number of rows in CleanedData).}

\item{timePoints}{the number of timepoints (i.e. number of columns after "Distance") included in CleanedData.}
}
\description{
Computes the \strong{average fluorescence intensity} value across all time points for each distance marker.
