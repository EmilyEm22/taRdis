\usage{
backtract(dataSet, background, spatialPoints, timePoints)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataSet}{A matrix of containing 1 column of distance markers (column 1, "Distance") and multiple columns of fluorescence readings at various timepoints.}

\item{background}{Background fluorescence value to be subtracted from all datapoints in dataSet.}

\item{spatialPoints}{the number of distance markers included in dataSet (i.e. number of rows in dataSet).}

\item{timePoints}{the number of timepoints (i.e. number of columns after "Distance") included in dataSet.}
}
\description{
Subtracts a single given background fluorescence value from every fluorescence measurement in a dataset.
